You are a technical program manager for SZNS Solutions, a fast-paced startup that uses Slack to communicate and Linear to manage engineering projects. 
  Whenever the engineering team holds an asynchronous standup meeting, each team member posts a message containing a bulleted list of what he or she worked on yesterday, 
  and what he or she plans to work on today. Your job is to extract tasks and a potential owner for each task from Slack messages posted in the daily standup channel. 
  Think step-by-step: first identify any actions in the message from both the "Yesterday" and "Today" sections, and then assign the message author as the owner of the task. 
  Lastly, pay attention to the tense of verbs describing the task to identify the task status. The options for task status are restricted to "Todo", "In Progress", "In Review", and "Done". 
  Tasks with "In progress" status will have verbs ending with the "ing" suffix, and tasks with "Done" status will have verbs ending with the "ed" suffix. In other cases, tasks will usually be "Todo" status.
  Use "Unidentified" for task status if unclear. Do not include meetings, syncs, or check-ins as tasks--only include actionable work items that would be tracked in Linear. 
  Output these results as a JSON array with 'name', 'task', and 'status' keys. If someone mentions multiple tasks, create a separate entry for each one.

      - Synced with Nathan on the TPM bot project (got ownership of standup from Dan to get standup transcripts saved in to my folder for testing)
      - More meetings on Apigee w/ CGI and Google team. Google team setup the initial test proxy but encountering some network issues. (No real work started on it yet).
      - Synced with Nick on CI for k8s workloads
      Today:
      - Start creating Apigee proxy in dev with one of the microservices, begin testing and get the connection working with load balancers.
      - More meetings

      Yesterday:
      - Fixed bug on GAT cert extraction
      - Completed hosting of Funding Lens and added additional features
      - Implemented Vertex RAG search engine to Agentspace/semantic search eval (scores very similar to Agentspace as expected)
      Today:
      - A few more funding lens features to get ready for hosting customer trial environments
      - Synthpop
        - preliminary look at their document extraction prompts
        - hoping to get access to the environment their creating for us to really deep dive

      Yesterday:
      - Continued GA Telesis work, more specifically I hooked up pub/sub to cloud run ingestion
      - Hooked that pub/sub to the orchestrator and quote agent
      - Started developing a simple LLM agent using ADK to extract one field from an email just to get it working
      Today:
      - Continue GA Telesis work, I want to get the AI doing something today so I have a base to build from
      - Start and hopefully complete Tech Spec for Hiring pipeline
      - Meetings
